The Whitney decomposition of a domain in Rn is an important tool in real and harmonic analysis. This
research proposal aims to explore the generalization of Whitney decomposition in two and three dimensions,
starting with the two-dimensional case. The project will develop a Mathematica implementation of the
decomposition, drawing inspiration from the implementation of Whitney decomposition in the plane in a
“Zipper” numerical conformal mapping package by Donald E. Marshall. Under the guidance of Associate
Professor Antti Rasila at GTIIT, student Yu Miao will participate in this research project
